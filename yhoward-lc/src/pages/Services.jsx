                      People 35 years and older may face a unique set of challenges as they navigate through
                      midlife and plans for retirement. Have you experienced the sweet taste of success only
                      to have it replaced by a lack of growth opportunities and/or complacency? Do you feel
                      pulled in too many directions? Is the life you are living, the life you want? When you are
                      ready to leave your daily monotony of existence, I will help guide you to recognize the
                      untapped opportunities and gifts needed to break through and break free!

                      Adoption is often considered a gift â€“ for both the adoptee and the adoptive parents. Yet
                      many times the adoptee is left with a multitude of unresolved thoughts and beliefs. Are
                      you considering seeking out your birth parents? Concerned about the potential
                      blowback from both adoptive and birth families if you do? Are you a transracial or
                      biracial adoptee who has had to grapple with living life between two or more worlds?
                      As a biracial adoptee from a closed adoption, come and be present in my safe place. I
                      can be a thought and a heart partner for you, as you find your sense of wholeness,
                      belonging, and inner peace.
